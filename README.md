# Churn Prediction Model

> **Note:** This is a prototype and not the actual code used in production.

## Overview
This project focuses on building a **Churn Prediction Model** using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict customer churn based on historical data, identifying key features that influence retention and providing actionable insights to reduce churn rates.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and data scaling.
- Model Training: Utilizing classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
- Model Evaluation: Performance metrics including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid Search and Random Search for model optimization.
- Interpretability: Feature importance analysis using SHAP values.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook (if running locally)
- Required dependencies from `requirements.txt`

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
